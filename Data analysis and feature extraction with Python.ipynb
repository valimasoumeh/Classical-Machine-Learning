This reduces your market risks by failing fast and cheap, to get you closer and closer to what the market really needs.\n",

For example, a low standard deviation suggests that data points tend to be close to the mean. Giving a quick look to our values, there's nothing that looks like obviously wrong.\n",

    "\n",
    "The word 'uncertainty' is key in this definition and it's also key in missing data. Missing data occurs when no data value on one or more variables is available. Consequently, it reduces the size of the data set and is a possible source of bias, since some non-random mechanism can be generating the missing data. As a result, missing data introduces uncertainty in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several strategies to deal with missing data. Some of the most common are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use only valid data, deleting the cases where data is missing.\n",
    "    Impute data using values from similar cases or using the mean value.\n",
    "    Impute data using model-based methods, in which models are defined to predict the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until today, I've never found a 'one size fits all' solution. I have some dogmas (e.g. I usually exclude variables with more than 25% of missing data), but what usually guides my analysis is intuition, critical thinking and need (sometimes we need to leave our dogmas at the door, if we want to generate some results).\n",
    "\n",
    "My practical advice to handle missing data is to learn a different set of tools. Play with them according to your needs, test them and you should be fine. A good introduction to the subject can be found in Hair et al. (2013). This book has a practical summary about missing data and provides a framework that you can apply in almost all situations. Also, I wrote a technical paper comparing different imputation techniques, which I can share with you if you want.\n",

This allowed us to quickly get a complete data set, in which was easy to identify imputed values. Since our goal was to have a working end-to-end pipeline as fast as possible, this approach was ok. However, it has several limitations. For example, we are using unrealistic replacement values, which are out of range and distort data distribution. Accordingly, now that we are improving the model, it makes sense to develop a different imputation method.\n",

    "One way to improve our imputation method is to estimate the missing values based on known relationships. In our case, we can do this by using the information in the variable 'Name'. Looking to 'Name' values, we can see person's name and title. Person's title is a relevant information to estimate ages. To give an example, we know that a person with the title 'Master' is someone under 13 years old, since 'a boy can be addressed as master only until age 12'. Therefore, employing the information in 'Name' we can improve our imputation method.\n",

When that happens, your analysis can end up like this.\n",

    "We can avoid this by following a hypothesis driven approach. The hypothesis driven approach consists in establishing hypothesis about the variables behaviour and their relationships, early in the process, to then focus on using data to prove (or disprove) those hypothesis.

Please note that, particularly when you really need to learn about the data set, it makes sense to put the diving cylinder and go dive into the depths of data analysis. However, if at the outset you can generate an educated guess of what the answer of your problem is, I think that you should test your hypothesis and learn from it as fast as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, now that I convinced you that the hypothesis driven approach is the last coke in the desert, let me show you how to apply it. Cases like the one we have are easy targets for the hypothesis driven approach because we don't have many variables, so we can more or less guess their impact. Accordingly, we will start by listing each of the variables and generate hypothesis about their relationship with the target variable ('Survived'). Then, we will test those hypothesis through a set of exploratory data analysis tools. As a result, we'll end up with a comprehensive view about the variables that should belong to our prediction model.\n",

    "    Pclass. This is the ticket class. According to Karl Marx, this should affect our target variable. First class should have a higher survival rate.\n",
    "    Name. Names are a form of social tagging, especially when accompanied by a title. As a consequence, it can lead to different forms of treatment. Let's keep an eye on this.\n",
    "    Sex. Always important.\n",
    "    Age. It should make a difference. For example, children are usually evacuated first in a disaster, so that we can think about a solution in silence... Joking, the true reason why 'Age' matters is this one.\n",
    "    SibSp. Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic. I'd say that it's easier to survive if you're with your family than if you're travelling alone. Teamwork!\n",
    "    Parch. Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic. It should play with 'SibSp'.\n",
    "    Ticket. This is the ticket number. Unless it has some information about places, it shouldn't be important for prediction purposes.\n",
    "    Fare. Same logic as 'Pclass'.\n",
    "    Cabin. The cabin number can indicate where people were during the disaster. It wouldn't be surprising if it had some influence in survival chances, but this variable was excluded due to the high percentage of missing values.\n",
    "    Embarked. When the sun rises, it rises for everyone. It's not expectable that people coming from Cherbourg are more unlucky than people coming from Southampton.

    "In the book 'How Google Works', Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg refer that Google's secret sauce is 'technical insight'. According to the authors, it is fundamental technical insight that allows companies to create great products, which provide real value to the customers. For example, PageRank gave an incredible competitive advantage to Google in relation to other search engines, by providing a far better way to rank search results on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction is our technological insight in machine learning. It addresses the problem of attaining the most informative and compact set of features, to improve the performance of machine learning models. Let's go step-by-step. First, we are talking about 'informative'. This means that we are looking for features that can characterize the behaviour of what we are trying to model. For instance, if we want to model the weather, features like temperature, humidity and wind are informative (they are related to the problem). By contrast, the result of a football game will not be an informative feature because it doesn't affect the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding 'compact', what we mean is that we want to exclude irrelevant features from our model. There are several reasons to exclude irrelevant features. In our case, I'd say that the most important is to reduce overfitting. Taking the weather example again: we know that football scores do not affect weather, but suppose that all rain instances in our training set happen to occur after a Benfica victory. Then, our model might learn that rain is related to Benfica's victories, which is not true. Such an incorrect generalization from an irrelevant feature of the training set would result in a machine learning model that fits a particular set of data, but fails to predict future observations reliably (overfitting).\n",

Based on these principles, the aim of this study was to improve data quality through exploratory data analysis and feature extraction. We didn't use a clever algorithm, but we explored clever techniques to make our data better.\n",

    "My expectation is that after reading this kernel, you can start compiling a cookbook of techniques in exploratory data analysis and feature extraction. These techniques will help you to obtain confidence in your data and engage with any data science problem. Also, the more you use and refine these techniques, the more you'll develop your problem solving intuition.\n",

    "Now, it's your turn. Make this work yours. Select a part of this kernel and play with it. Why not trying a different feature selection process? Or what about applying a different imputation method? There are a hundred different ways to steal this work like an artist. Do it... After all, all unicorns started with a MVP.\n"
