    "    Build. Figure out the problem that needs to be solved, generate ideas about how to solve it, and select the best one. Turn your best idea into a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).\n",

    "    Learn. Analyse the data you collected when testing the product with your customers. Draw conclusions from the experiment and decide what to do next. In other words, this is a validated learning process that quickly builds, tests, and rebuilds products, according to users' feedback. This reduces your market risks by failing fast and cheap, to get you closer and closer to what the market really needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kernel does something similar. We will try to fail fast and cheap by quickly building a working end-to-end pipeline (Build). Then, we will instrument the system to evaluate its performance (Measure). Finally, we will make incremental changes to improve the system's performance (Learn). Note that this practical methodology was adapted from Goodfellow et al. (2016), a book you can access for free here.\n",
    "\n",

    "There are three aspects that usually catch my attention when I analyse descriptive statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Min and max values. This can give us an idea about the range of values and is helpful to detect outliers. In our case, all the min and max values seem reasonable and in a reasonable range of values. The only exception could eventually be the max value of 'Fare', but for now we will leave it as it is.\n",
    "    Mean and standard deviation. The mean shows us the central tendency of the distribution, while the standard deviation quantifies its amount of variation. For example, a low standard deviation suggests that data points tend to be close to the mean. Giving a quick look to our values, there's nothing that looks like obviously wrong.\n",
    "    Count. This is important to give us a first perception about the volume of missing data. Here, we can see that some 'Age' data is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there's nothing shocking about the variables, let's proceed to the next step: missing data.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of my favourite definitions of startup belongs to Eric Ries: 'a startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word 'uncertainty' is key in this definition and it's also key in missing data. Missing data occurs when no data value on one or more variables is available. Consequently, it reduces the size of the data set and is a possible source of bias, since some non-random mechanism can be generating the missing data. As a result, missing data introduces uncertainty in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several strategies to deal with missing data. Some of the most common are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use only valid data, deleting the cases where data is missing.\n",
    "    Impute data using values from similar cases or using the mean value.\n",
    "    Impute data using model-based methods, in which models are defined to predict the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until today, I've never found a 'one size fits all' solution. I have some dogmas (e.g. I usually exclude variables with more than 25% of missing data), but what usually guides my analysis is intuition, critical thinking and need (sometimes we need to leave our dogmas at the door, if we want to generate some results).\n",
    "\n",
    "My practical advice to handle missing data is to learn a different set of tools. Play with them according to your needs, test them and you should be fine. A good introduction to the subject can be found in Hair et al. (2013). This book has a practical summary about missing data and provides a framework that you can apply in almost all situations. Also, I wrote a technical paper comparing different imputation techniques, which I can share with you if you want.\n",

    "The 'Minimum Viable Product' (MVP) is a key concept for any lean startup. Once the problem to solve is figured out, the focus of the startup should be in the development of a solution, the MVP, as fast as they can. Thanks to the MVP, it is possible to begin the learning process and improve the solution towards users needs.\n",

    "Goodfellow et al. (2016) proposes an analogous approach for the application of machine learning models. As the authors point out, the successful application of machine learning techniques goes beyond the knowledge of algorithms and their principles. To successfully apply machine learning techniques, we need to start with a simple model that we can master and understand. Only then we should move to more complex algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors propose a practical four-steps methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Select a performance metric and a target value for this metric. This metric will guide your work and allow you to know how well you're performing. In our case, our performance metric will be 'accuracy' because it is the one defined by Kaggle.\n",
    "    Quickly set up a working end-to-end pipeline. This should allow you to estimate the selected performance metric.\n",
    "    Monitor the system to understand its behaviour, in particular to understand whether its poor performance is related to underfitting, overfitting or defects.\n",
    "    Improve the system by iteration. Here we can apply feature engineering, tune hyperparameters or even change the algorithm, according to the outputs of our monitoring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow this methodology. Accordingly, our aim will be to get an initial model that we can use as a first baseline approach. This model will be our 'Minimum Viable Model' (MVM). Note that right now it doesn't matter much how well the model performs. We just need a starting point. All in all, we're entrepreneurs. Worst case scenario, we name this model as 'beta version' :P\n",

    "Learning curves in a nutshell:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Learning curves allow us to diagnose if the is overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "    When the model overfits, it means that it performs well on the training set, but not not on the validation set. Accordingly, the model is not able to generalize to unseen data. If the model is overfitting, the learning curve will present a gap between the training and validation scores. Two common solutions for overfitting are reducing the complexity of the model and/or collect more data.\n",
    "    On the other hand, underfitting means that the model is not able to perform well in either training or validations sets. In those cases, the learning curves will converge to a low score value. When the model underfits, gathering more data is not helpful because the model is already not being able to learn the training data. Therefore, the best approaches for these cases are to improve the model (e.g., tuning the hyperparameters) or to improve the quality of the data (e.g., collecting a different set of features).\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion of our results:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The model doesn't overfit. As we can see, the curves converge and no gap between the training and the validation score exists in the last points of the curve.\n",
    "    The model underfits. Our final score is about 0.786. Although our model does better predictions than a flip-a-coin strategy, it is still far from being an 'intelligent' model. For now, it's just an 'artificial' model."

    "    Validation curves are a tool that we can use to improve the performance of our model. It counts as a way of tuning our hyperparameters.\n",
    "    They are different from the learning curves. Here, the goal is to see how the model parameter impacts the training and validation scores. This allow us to choose a different value for the parameter, to improve the model.\n",
    "    Once again, if there is a gap between the training and the validation score, the model is probably overfitting. In contrast, if there is no gap but the score value is low, we can say that the model underfits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion of our results:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The figure shows that there is no huge difference in model's performance as far as we choose a C value of 10−1\n",
    "\n",
    "or higher. Note that in a logistic regression, C is the only model parameter that we can change (see scikit-learn documentation). "

    "At this point, our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Can achieve a 0.786 +/- 0.026 accuracy.\n",
    "    Is based on a logistic regression.\n",
    "    Uses 'Pclass', 'Age', 'Fare', 'FamilySize', 'Sex', and 'Embarked as inputs; and 'Survived' as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, concerning the practical methodology that we mentioned before, we can say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The choice of the performance metric is a closed topic because we're following Kaggle's specifications.\n",
    "    Our current model can work as a baseline model and resulted from a working end-to-end pipeline.\n",
    "    The learning and validation curves allow us to monitor system's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, only the fourth and last step of the practical methodology is missing: to improve the model by iteration. This can be done by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Improving the way how we handled 'Age' missing data. In our lean approach we decided to replace missing data by a unique value, but now we can go deeper and search for a better imputation strategy.\n",
    "    Exploring data to understand which features can have impact in the model and how they can be manipulated to boost that impact.\n",
    "    Building new features that can increase the predictive power of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will lead us to a heavy data analysis process, which aims to improve model's performance just by the data quality side. In other words, we will not change our learning algorithm neither we will try to improve its parameters. We will only try to improve the performance of our model by enriching our data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our initial approach to estimate 'Age' missing values was to fill with a placeholder value (1000). This allowed us to quickly get a complete data set, in which was easy to identify imputed values. Since our goal was to have a working end-to-end pipeline as fast as possible, this approach was ok. However, it has several limitations. For example, we are using unrealistic replacement values, which are out of range and distort data distribution. Accordingly, now that we are improving the model, it makes sense to develop a different imputation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve our imputation method is to estimate the missing values based on known relationships. In our case, we can do this by using the information in the variable 'Name'. Looking to 'Name' values, we can see person's name and title. Person's title is a relevant information to estimate ages. To give an example, we know that a person with the title 'Master' is someone under 13 years old, since 'a boy can be addressed as master only until age 12'. Therefore, employing the information in 'Name' we can improve our imputation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to implement this new imputation method are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extract titles from 'Name'.\n",
    "    Plot a figure with both features and confirm that there is a connection between titles and age.\n",
    "    For each title, get people's average age and use it to fill missing values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis is often mentioned as one of the most important steps in the data analysis process. However, it's fairly easy to fall into a 'data diving' trap (especially if you're solving problems about sunken ships) and get lost into the process. When that happens, your analysis can end up like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can avoid this by following a hypothesis driven approach. The hypothesis driven approach consists in establishing hypothesis about the variables behaviour and their relationships, early in the process, to then focus on using data to prove (or disprove) those hypothesis. This makes our analysis very objective because we will be collecting just enough data to test specific hypothesis. As a result, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Increase speed. Since we will limit our analysis to some hypothesis and move forward.\n",
    "    Reduce effort. The amount of data and the number of tests will be only what is needed to verify your hypothesis.\n",
    "    Reduce risk. If you're right you succeed fast, if you're wrong you fail fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can find one of my favourite PowerPoint presentations about the benefits and procedures of a hypothesis driven approach in problem solving. Please note that, particularly when you really need to learn about the data set, it makes sense to put the diving cylinder and go dive into the depths of data analysis. However, if at the outset you can generate an educated guess of what the answer of your problem is, I think that you should test your hypothesis and learn from it as fast as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, now that I convinced you that the hypothesis driven approach is the last coke in the desert, let me show you how to apply it. Cases like the one we have are easy targets for the hypothesis driven approach because we don't have many variables, so we can more or less guess their impact. Accordingly, we will start by listing each of the variables and generate hypothesis about their relationship with the target variable ('Survived'). Then, we will test those hypothesis through a set of exploratory data analysis tools. As a result, we'll end up with a comprehensive view about the variables that should belong to our prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "    PassengerId. This is just an unique identification of each passenger. It's not expected to be relevant to our analysis.\n",
    "    Survived. Target variable. To sink or not to sink is the question of this exercise.\n",
    "    Pclass. This is the ticket class. According to Karl Marx, this should affect our target variable. First class should have a higher survival rate.\n",
    "    Name. Names are a form of social tagging, especially when accompanied by a title. As a consequence, it can lead to different forms of treatment. Let's keep an eye on this.\n",
    "    Sex. Always important.\n",
    "    Age. It should make a difference. For example, children are usually evacuated first in a disaster, so that we can think about a solution in silence... Joking, the true reason why 'Age' matters is this one.\n",
    "    SibSp. Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic. I'd say that it's easier to survive if you're with your family than if you're travelling alone. Teamwork!\n",
    "    Parch. Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic. It should play with 'SibSp'.\n",
    "    Ticket. This is the ticket number. Unless it has some information about places, it shouldn't be important for prediction purposes.\n",
    "    Fare. Same logic as 'Pclass'.\n",
    "    Cabin. The cabin number can indicate where people were during the disaster. It wouldn't be surprising if it had some influence in survival chances, but this variable was excluded due to the high percentage of missing values.\n",
    "    Embarked. When the sun rises, it rises for everyone. It's not expectable that people coming from Cherbourg are more unlucky than people coming from Southampton. Unless there is some second order effect, like refusing to run away to keep your honor as a man, I would say that this variable is not important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, step by step, let's perform our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2.1. Pclass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is that the higher the class, the higher the chances of survival. This means that a person travelling in the first class has a higher chance of survival than a person traveling on the second or third class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize if there is a relationship between 'Pclass' and 'Survival', let's do a bar plot.\n"

    "    Titles with a survival rate higher than 50% are those that correspond to female (Miss or Mrs) or children (Master) titles.\n",
    "    Our new category, 'Other', should be more discretized. As we can see by the error bar (black line), there is a significant uncertainty around the mean value. Probably, one of the problems is that we are mixing male and female titles in the 'Other' category. We should proceed with a more detailed analysis to sort this out. Also, the category 'Master' seems to have a similar problem. For now, we will not make any changes, but we will keep these two situations in our mind for future improvement of our data set.\n",

    "Sex is one of the most discussed topics in Human history. There are several perspective about the topic, but I must confess that Freud's perspectives had a significant impact on me because they have shown me the subject in a new perspective. What's new about Freud is that he associated many 'normal' behaviours to sexual drives, almost to the point of making us question everything we do. In the end, Freud realized that not everything was about sex. As he said, 'sometimes a cigar is just a cigar' (Freud used to smoke cigars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Preambles aside, what we really need to know is if sometimes a cigar is just a cigar or not. We already have some clues that, in Titanic, women had a higher survival rate. But, nothing better than a plot to see what's going on.\n"

    "In the book 'How Google Works', Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg refer that Google's secret sauce is 'technical insight'. According to the authors, it is fundamental technical insight that allows companies to create great products, which provide real value to the customers. For example, PageRank gave an incredible competitive advantage to Google in relation to other search engines, by providing a far better way to rank search results on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction is our technological insight in machine learning. It addresses the problem of attaining the most informative and compact set of features, to improve the performance of machine learning models. Let's go step-by-step. First, we are talking about 'informative'. This means that we are looking for features that can characterize the behaviour of what we are trying to model. For instance, if we want to model the weather, features like temperature, humidity and wind are informative (they are related to the problem). By contrast, the result of a football game will not be an informative feature because it doesn't affect the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding 'compact', what we mean is that we want to exclude irrelevant features from our model. There are several reasons to exclude irrelevant features. In our case, I'd say that the most important is to reduce overfitting. Taking the weather example again: we know that football scores do not affect weather, but suppose that all rain instances in our training set happen to occur after a Benfica victory. Then, our model might learn that rain is related to Benfica's victories, which is not true. Such an incorrect generalization from an irrelevant feature of the training set would result in a machine learning model that fits a particular set of data, but fails to predict future observations reliably (overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "These two main issues are addressed in the following sub-sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature engineering, which is related to the generation of informative features;\n",
    "    Feature selection, which regards the choice of a compact set of features.\n",

    "Feature engineering is the art of converting raw data into useful features. There are several feature engineering techniques that you can apply to be an artist. A comprehensive list of them is presented by Heaton (2016). We will use just two techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Box-Cox transformations (Box & Cox 1964);\n",
    "    Polynomials generation through non-linear expansions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the application of these techniques, we will just make some adjustments to the data, in order to prepare it for the modelling process.\n",

    "As Halevy et al. (2009) noted 'invariably, simple models and a lot of data trump more elaborate models based on less data.' Monica Rogati added that 'better data beats more data'. Based on these principles, the aim of this study was to improve data quality through exploratory data analysis and feature extraction. We didn't use a clever algorithm, but we explored clever techniques to make our data better.\n",

    "My expectation is that after reading this kernel, you can start compiling a cookbook of techniques in exploratory data analysis and feature extraction. These techniques will help you to obtain confidence in your data and engage with any data science problem. Also, the more you use and refine these techniques, the more you'll develop your problem solving intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's your turn. Make this work yours. Select a part of this kernel and play with it. Why not trying a different feature selection process? Or what about applying a different imputation method? There are a hundred different ways to steal this work like an artist. Do it... After all, all unicorns started with a MVP.\n"
